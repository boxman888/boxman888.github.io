    <p>
        Hi, my name is Ethan Patterson! I created this webpage so you
         could learn a little more about me. That and to practice a little HTML and CSS. Front end work is not something I do very often, so it is good to practice with it occasionally.

        I grew up in a small town in North Eastern Oregon near the Eagle Cap Mountains. This was a gorgeous area to grow up in. I highly recommend visiting Joseph Oregon and spending some time at Wallowa lake if you are in the area.

            I recently graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in computer science (CS) and with a minor in in actuarial science. Oregon State allows CS students to pick a specific focus in the CS field. This can be quite the range of topics, as CS intertwines with just about any other field. My focus was on artificial intelligence. I chose this option as it had a stronger focus in math and algorithms. I feel this gave me a good breadth of knowledge in this sector. However, I am no where near an expert in this area.

            I have always had an interest in technology, but I found my interest in CS in elementary school after taking an after-school programming class instructed by a local parent. This class used the Java programming language and focused on basic syntax and scope.
        </p>
        <p>
            From this after-school class I was informed about a program called First Robotic Competition (FRC) which was offered as a club. In this program I learned important skills ranging from software development, electrical systems, and fabrication.

            I also participated in another club, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). Here I competed in the computer game simulation challenge. This challenge would change yearly. However, the idea was given some topic make a computer game that meet that desired criteria. My team won first place at the state level in Oregon in 2014 and 2015.

            In collage I participated in MATES Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) program for two years. In this program teams build an ROV that must complete a series of tasks, such as stopping a simulated underwater oil leak.
